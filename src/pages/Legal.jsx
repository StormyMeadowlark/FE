              <p>
                At HEM Automotive, we strive to ensure your satisfaction with
                your vehicle purchase. However, as all vehicle sales are final,
                please carefully review the following policy:
              </p>
            </li>
            <li className="pt-8">
              <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold pb-4 text-[#00ff00]">
                1. All Sales Are Final
              </h4>
              <p>
                Once a vehicle purchase is completed, it is considered final.
                Kansas law does not provide a cooling-off period or right to
                return a vehicle once the contract is signed.
              </p>
            </li>

              <h4 className="text-2xl font-bold pb-4 text-[#00ff00]">
                2. Warranty Coverage
              </h4>
              <p>
                Any applicable warranties provided at the time of sale will
                detail specific repair or replacement coverage. Please review
                your warranty agreement for more information.
              </p>
              <p>
                If no warranty is provided, the vehicle is sold "as-is," meaning
                all repairs and maintenance become the buyer’s responsibility.

              </h4>
              <p>
                We encourage all customers to conduct a thorough pre-purchase
                inspection or bring a trusted mechanic to review the vehicle
                before purchase.

                sales. Customers will receive a detailed history report and
                disclosure of any known issues before purchase.
